# These tests are separated into a separate file to be able to use secrets when running in a fork.
# To avoid leaking secrets, we only allow contributors to run the tests.
# Note that pull_request_trigger runs from the base branch, not the head branch.
# So, we need to manually check out the head ref and merge the base branch into it.
