@notice
    Votes have a weight depending on time, so that users are
    committed to the future of whatever they are voting for.
@dev
    The voting power is capped at 4 years, but the lock can exceed that duration.
    Vote weight decays linearly over time.
    A user can unlock funds early incurring a penalty.
