<h1><strong>Installing Titanoboa</strong></h1>

Titanoboa requires Python 3.9 or later to function properly.

## Install Using Moccasin

    [Moccasin](https://github.com/cyfrin/moccasin) is a CLI tool that wraps Boa, providing a smoother and more feature-rich development experience. If you are accustomed to frameworks like Foundry, youâ€™ll likely want to install Moccasin. Refer to the [Moccasin documentation](https://cyfrin.github.io/moccasin/) for more details.

If you have installed Moccasin and used `mox init` to set up your project, Titanoboa is already included as a dependency.
